Lone Wolf IT Official Website

This is the source code for my website, lonewolfit.io -- This is the development branch. Website has a user database, login/register, stripe integration, testimonials, reviews, and more.

If you wish, you may clone this repo and explore the source code. Please DO NOT host this on another URL or use my source code without my permission.
You may refer to my source code, but the inherit designs are copyrighted by me.

You may see the PRODUCTION branch (other repo) in live action at
https://www.lonewolfit.io

To deploy, simply clone this repo to a folder on a Apache 2 server, and create a .conf file that points to it. Or you can open it in VSCode and use the "Live Server" plugin, and view the webpage that way.

I plan to add recapchas, a webstore, and more to the website.
